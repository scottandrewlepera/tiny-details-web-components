# Web Components

A collection of tiny and useful web components.

## Tenets

* **Inessential.** The functionality provided by these web components must never be required and their absence must never prevent the user from completing a task.
* **Minimal.** Each web component contains only necessary code. APIs are the JS event model and CSS classes.
* **Agnostic.** Web components are vanilla JS and unstyled, and can be used with any web framework or design system.

## Components

* Copy to clipboard - add a button that copies any specified text to the clipboard
* Password reveal - add a switch to any password field that reveals the password
* Max character counter - use with any textarea to display a counter indicating the remaining characters allowed.
