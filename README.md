# Tiny Details Web Components

A collection of tiny and useful web components for improving the user experience of any website.

## Tenets

* **Inessential.** The functionality provided by these web components must never be required and their absence must never prevent the user from completing a task.
* **Minimal.** Usage requires zero changes to existing HTML. No dependencies, zero-config, web-standard APIs.
* **Agnostic.** Unstyled vanilla JS for use with any web framework or design system.

## Components

* [Copy to clipboard](./docs/copy-to-clipboard.md) - add a button that copies any specified text to the clipboard
* [Password reveal](./docs/password-reveal.md) - add a switch to any password field that reveals the password
* [Max character counter](./docs/max-character-counter.md) - use with any textarea to display a counter indicating the remaining characters allowed.
